**BEIJING** – Use of the term “Chinalize” sparked controversy during a lecture by a Chinese professor for 48 Asian and African journalists in one of [China’s leading universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renmin_University_of_China), [Renmin](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en).

When asked about how to develop Africa, the professor made up a word “Chinalize”, trying to sell the way of development with Chinese characteristics.

However, this word provoked an online protest from the African audience who refuse to become more like Chinese people in culture and values. Angry Malawian journalist [Yvonnie Sundu](https://www.mwnation.com/author/yvonne-sundu/) wrote a list of 10 questions for this professor. “Africa for example is mostly a shadow of the West where people copy what they see. What’s wrong with Africans?”

The professor later clarified his original meaning was localizing as responding to Sundu’s questions.

“For instance, China doesn’t have Google, but has a ‘Chinalized’ Google with the same function. That is Baidu. Chinalization is not colonization or Americanization. It is localization of imported technology and equipment.”

Sundu then agrees in our interview, “Chinese way of development is worthy emulating by Africa and all development-conscious countries.”

Regardless of whether it was a miscommunication, Sundu says the African reaction reveals how sensitive they view the Chinese presence on the African continent. China has aroused debate over whether African countries are benefiting or simply being used. [Elizabeth Manero](https://harvardpolitics.com/world/chinas-investment-in-africa-the-new-colonialism/), an author at Harvard Political Review, wrote that the region might gain economic growth from China, but this raises questions about the true cost.

Instead of giving local citizens job opportunities, Chinese companies tend to hire Chinese nationals coming over to Africa, according to Zhang Xianmin, a Chinese staff at [CGC Nigeria Limited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGCOC_Group), local people hardly feel the help in economy.

Concerns even lie in [Chinese political engagement in Africa](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR521.html). Beijing provided military support to the Sudanese and Zimbabwean regimes, which has been controversial.

“There’s resentment in Africans against the Chinese and not necessarily China as a country,” Sundu mentions, “for example in Malawi, there have been cases of Chinese being arrested for [carrying excess foreign currency](https://www.mwnation.com/chinese-national-arrested-over-k4-2m-forex/) and [being in possession of ivory](https://www.mwnation.com/chinese-ivory-smuggler-fined-k50-000/). In Ghana, there are cases where Chinese are [involved in illegal mining](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/06/201367934304981.html).”

Is China prepared to smooth the tension? [Zhong Xin](http://jcr.ruc.edu.cn/en/Faculty_and_Staff/content-787.html), chief organizer of the [one-year Asian and African journalists’ program](http://jcr.ruc.edu.cn/xinwen/dongtai/content-1269.html), says “China is a good partner of African nations, [promoting South-South Cooperation](http://www.ecns.cn/2015/10-06/183400.shtml) in every field.”

In Zhong’s perspective, beyond economic gains, China has spurred development of schools, hospitals and social infrastructure for better ecosystem and long-term interests in the region.

This program can show China’s effort in people-to-people communication, especially in the elite and opinion leaders.

“Government-to-government communication is less effective in [tumult of regime change in Africa,](https://www.politicsweb.co.za/news-and-analysis/gambia-africa-does-regime-change)” Zhang Xianmin suggests, “interpersonal communication can lead to lasting results.”
