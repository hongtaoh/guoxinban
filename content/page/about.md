### Bt Michael J. Jordan, Visiting Professor, Renmin University of China

China is not only the world’s most-populous nation, but also the largest English-learning market: [some have estimated](https://www.economist.com/johnson/2011/09/01/how-many-english-learners-in-china) that 300 million-plus Chinese have taken up the language.

Yet what I believe the world’s second-largest economy truly needs are more Chinese who write well – as a bridge to the outside world, explaining the work of Chinese organizations, companies and government agencies, or describing the lives of ordinary Chinese.

Each of my 29 Chinese graduate students, then, represents a potential bridge. That’s one driving force behind this course, as I’ve shown them how to produce two kinds of stories: News Writing and International Journalism.

I try to demystify the entire process, by leading my Student-Journalists through each stage, step-by-step: from how to identify, finesse and “pitch” a story to any editor (or any idea to any kind of boss); through the research, reporting, interviewing, writing, critiquing, revising, polishing and publishing. For examples of our class discussions, please visit our Lessons Shared section – and our Dirty Dozen challenges.

One disclaimer: in reading our stories, they may not seem perfectly polished. More noteworthy, though, is that each story was produced by a student writing in their second, third, even fourth language. While I critiqued the stories, and the students polished them into the best possible condition, I left them “imperfect” – to showcase what the students have achieved … and are truly capable of producing.

Speaking of which, my second objective for this course: to equip my students with both the skills and “products” to help them find a decent job or internship, after graduation – ideally, in their preferred field or industry. I see the strategies and techniques that I teach – drawn from my own career as a Foreign Correspondent – as building blocks for a more successful career, as they’ll enable my students to visualize a strategy for how to effectively generate any future writings or communications.

I’ve also urged them to create a personal website, as a platform and showcase for all of their relevant work – especially in English. Even if these stories are only included in their CV/portfolio, the professional skills on display would surely impress any prospective employer.

The journalism principle of Show, Don’t Tell rings true here, too: Show employers what you’re capable of doing. I’m proud to say that each of my 29 Student-Journalists has accomplished that here.
