<p>We’re 29 enthusiastic Chinese youth, from across China – and one energetic American journalism teacher. For more of our thoughts, please visit the Lessons Learned section.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our teacher, Michael J. Jordan, is a Beijing-based Communications Consultant, International Educator, <a href="http://www.princetonow.com/en/team">Academic Advisor</a> and <a href="http://toleducation.org/courses/international-storytelling-course-july-2016/">Storytelling Specialist</a>. Drawing upon the strategies and techniques learned from his two decades as an international journalist, Jordan teaches students how to overcome a core challenge of Strategic Communications: how to effectively reach and impact any smart, curious, global, but non-expert audience.</p>
<p>As a Foreign Correspondent, Jordan has reported from 30 countries – mostly in Eastern Europe and Southern Africa – for publications like Foreign Policy, Agence France-Presse, the Christian Science Monitor, the Global Post, Harvard’s Nieman Reports, and South Africa’s Mail &amp; Guardian.</p>
<p>Before moving to China, Jordan lived in the tiny African kingdom of Lesotho, which suffers the world’s second-highest rate of HIV. He was the lone Western correspondent to cover Lesotho’s 2014 coup-attempt and <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/27/the-mountain-kingdom-on-the-brink/">months of instability</a> afterward.</p>
<p>Jordan has taught and trained several thousand students and professionals on four continents: from New York to Hong Kong, from Prague to Lesotho. In 14 years of teaching courses and leading workshops, he has always developed and taught his own curriculum.</p>
<p>His International Reporting methodology was published by the training academy of the German media giant, Deutsche Welle. He’s also published a chapter on key storytelling differences between International Communications and International Journalism.</p>

            <h4>NO, he&#39;s not that Michael Jordan</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Today in China, Jordan teaches International Journalism and Communications to graduate students at two of Beijing’s finest schools – Renmin University and Beijing Foreign Studies University – and is a seven-time <a href="http://comd.hkbu.edu.hk/masters/zh-hant/index.html">Visiting Scholar</a> at Hong Kong Baptist University. In September 2017 he’ll return to the students of the Shanghai International Studies University, to teach his one-month Foreign Reporting from Shanghai intensive – which he modeled after THIS course.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his Communications Consultancies have ranged from HIV orphans, maternal-health and gender-based violence in Africa, to labor issues, environmental protection and Food Waste in China. He helps organizations to dig deeper beneath “success stories,” to illuminate real on-the-ground impact.</p>
<p>This focus began in Africa, as he brought to life one NGO’s positive impact on HIV Orphans: he interviewed, photographed and profiled 24 beneficiaries for this digital e-book, then detailed his new storytelling method: The Fork in the Road.</p>
<p>In Beijing last year, in a Consultancy for the UN’s International Labor Organization, he trained Chinese ILO experts to raise awareness of worker’s rights through storytelling, like these two “impact stories” on the ILO website: <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/features/WCMS_472313/lang--en/index.htm">Ergonomics in China: Tackling Workplace Stress</a> and Healthcare Workers Care For Us, But Who’s Caring For Them?</p>
<p>Earlier this year, he completed his own Advocacy-through-Storytelling project – funded by the U.S. Embassy in Beijing – for Youth Environmental Education: The Chinese Champions of Environmental Protection. The China Daily <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/culture/2016-11/09/content_27319737.htm">featured his efforts</a>, and he later published those stories <a href="https://chinesechampions.wordpress.com/">on this website</a>, which he created.</p>
<p>More recently, for the China office of IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute, Jordan designed, researched, scripted and hosted <a href="https://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjkxMzQxODQyNA==.html?spm=a2h0j.8191423.playlist_content.5!2~5~5~A&amp;&amp;f=50472781&amp;o=0&amp;from=y1.2-3.4.2">a series of 10 instructional videos</a> (access code: 12345). This teaches Storytelling-in-Communications to Chinese youth – as an advocacy tool to reduce Food Waste in China.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jordan is also an Education Counselor who has adapted his skills in International Storytelling, to mentor Chinese teens applying to top U.S. boarding-schools and <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5NjMwNjUwMQ==&amp;mid=2649795026&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=08d7a8a8539480321cd1d50309c5adb4&amp;chksm=beef42f88998cbeee215dcb969f78f7e429b66003896bd1113741351cd96c79f9fb8fe417b3b&amp;mpshare=1&amp;scene=1&amp;srcid=0505xi9yI9Cu0VM7u5vlXDE4&amp;pass_tic">American universities</a> – guiding them to write their most persuasive Personal Essays. He has done this for a leading <a href="http://www.princetonow.com/en/team">college-advising company</a> in Shenzhen; as a Consultant for one of China’s finest International School networks: Dulwich College; and as a guest speaker for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.</p>
