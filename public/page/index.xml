      <description>Bt Michael J. Jordan, Visiting Professor, Renmin University of China China is not only the world’s most-populous nation, but also the largest English-learning market: some have estimated that 300 million-plus Chinese have taken up the language.
Yet what I believe the world’s second-largest economy truly needs are more Chinese who write well – as a bridge to the outside world, explaining the work of Chinese organizations, companies and government agencies, or describing the lives of ordinary Chinese.</description>

      <description>By Michael J. Jordan, Visiting Professor, Renmin University of China Our first course assignment – which generated this batch of stories – was to spotlight any News story on campus.
However, as I instructed the students, do NOT produce your story as if for the campus newspaper – for a local, “insider” audience. Instead, as if for a global news agency, aiming for that “smart, curious, international audience.”
This story teaches the core fundamentals of preparation, fact-gathering, interviewing and effective writing, which, as I told our Student-Journalists, “You’ll need for any career.</description>

      <description>Know My Audience Well By Chenwei Fan I was quite confused when Michael asked us to include “Darwinian origins and evolution” of the issue we wanted to cover. We had to spend almost 50% of the article explaining earlier trend of the issue. Shall I call this news writing at all?
After 16 weeks with Michael, I have found the answer to my question. It is all about how to impact my target audience effectively.</description>

      <description>By Michael J. Jordan, Visiting Professor, Renmin University of China Beyond my two decades as a Foreign Correspondent, I’ve taught various forms of International Journalism over the past 14 years – on four continents. And the same challenge I faced with this group of Chinese students, I experienced when teaching in New York, or Central Europe, or Southern Africa, or in Hong Kong.
To be fair, imagine yourself in their shoes: they’re young Chinese, living in their homeland, yet trying to portray it accurately as possible, for outsiders – the vast majority of whom have never been to China.</description>

      <description>By Michael J. Jordan, Visiting Professor, Renmin University of China Our second course assignment was an illuminating piece of Foreign Reporting — or, as I also presented it: International Storytelling. From that, we produced this collection of 14 “humanized, fact-based” stories.
A core challenge was to show my young Chinese Student-Journalists how to think – and produce stories – as I would, as a Foreign Correspondent. No small feat, as they’d be doing so from their ownhomeland.</description>

      <description>By Michael J. Jordan, Visiting Professor, Renmin University of China   Who We Are   We’re 29 enthusiastic Chinese youth, from across China – and one energetic American journalism teacher. For more of our thoughts, please visit the Lessons Learned section.
Meanwhile, our teacher, Michael J. Jordan, is a Beijing-based Communications Consultant, International Educator, Academic Advisor and Storytelling Specialist. Drawing upon the strategies and techniques learned from his two decades as an international journalist, Jordan teaches students how to overcome a core challenge of Strategic Communications: how to effectively reach and impact any smart, curious, global, but non-expert audience.</description>
