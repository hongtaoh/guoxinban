      <description>BEIJING – Use of the term “Chinalize” sparked controversy during a lecture by a Chinese professor for 48 Asian and African journalists in one of China’s leading universities, Renmin.
When asked about how to develop Africa, the professor made up a word “Chinalize”, trying to sell the way of development with Chinese characteristics.
However, this word provoked an online protest from the African audience who refuse to become more like Chinese people in culture and values.</description>
