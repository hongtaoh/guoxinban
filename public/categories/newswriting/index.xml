But this year, some young women at Renmin University of China, at least, chose this occasion to hang some incongruous banners to voice their dissatisfaction with what they see as gender discrimination.</description>

According to China Electricity Council, in 2016, 65.2% of the power generated in China was from firing coal. China, the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, does need such an hour to “cool down.</description>
